<p> During the holiday season, there is typically a sense of joy that "shoots up in the air". Mostly everyone feels this happiness within them, especially children. Now usually they're at home with their families. Besides gift wrapping (or rather unwrapping), what other hobbies can you share at home? Yep, that's right....making a gingerbread house.</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
<li> ¾ cup of butter</li>

 <li> ⅞ cup of packed light brown sugar</li>
    
 <li> 1 teaspoon lemon zest</li>
    
 <li> 1 ½ tablespoons of lemon juice</li>
    
 <li> ½ cup molasses</li>
    
 <li> 2 eggs</li>
    
 <li> 3 cups all-purpose flour</li>
    
 <li> 2 teaspoons baking powder
    
 <li> 1 tablespoon ground ginger </li>
    
 <li> 2 teaspoons ground allspice </li>
    
 <li> 6 egg whites </li>
    
 <li>4 (16 ounce) packages confectioners' sugar, sifted</li>

</ul>

<h3>Steps</h3>
<ol>
<li>Cut everything out in thin cardboards </li>
   <ul>
    <li> A 4 ½  x 8 in. side wall</li>
    <li> 4 ½ x 5 in. end wall</li>
    <li>4 ½ x 3 x 3 in. triangular gable</li>
    <li>4 ½ x 9 in. roof rectangle</li>
   </ul>
<li>Be sure to tape the rectangular end wall piece to the triangular gable piece, then match the long side of the triangle, 4 1/2 inches, to one of the 4 1/2 inch sides of the end wall.</li>
<li>Mix butter and sugar in a bowl until it gets creamy; Proceed to add lemon zest, lemon juice, and molasses into the mixture. Slowly beat 2 eggs into the bowl before adding sitf flour, baking powder, ginger, and allspice inside; stir everything until the creaminess comes through; Using parchment paper, wrap the dough inside and refrigerate for 1 hour.</li>
<li>Preheat the oven to approx. 375 degrees F (190 degrees C)</li>
<li>Take the dough out and divide them into 6 portions>>>2 larger pieces and 4 smaller ones; Use the 4 smaller pieces for the end wall/side wall w/ gable templates and cut out 2 each</li>
<li>For the remaining dough, roll them out and cut into 2 separate rectangular roof pieces; Place the gingerbread inside greased baking trays</li>
<li>Bake the gingerbread for about 10 min. in the preheated oven before removing them and leaving the trays out to set for a few minutes; Transfer the trays to wire racks before leaving them out for 8 hours overnight, in order for them to harden</li>
<li>Lightly whisk 2 egg whites in a larger bowl and slowly beat in about 5 cups of confectioners' sugar; Doing so should help make the icing firmer and smoother</li>
<li>Spread about 9-inch or more of icing line ontop of the cake board and around the edges of the side walls and end walls to help connect them together; Leave it to harden for around 2 hours </li>
<li>Spread a thick layer of icing on top of all the walls; Place the roof pieces in proper position; Pipe the icings on the remaining areas of the gingerbread house. </li>
<li>To finish decorating the exteriors, whisk 4 egg whites lightly in a large bowl before mixing it w/ the leftover confectioners' sugar; This will create the illusion of snow; Glue additional candies with the icing before finally ending your work with some fine dusting of the sifted confectioners' sugar. </li>
